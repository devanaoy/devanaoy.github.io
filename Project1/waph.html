            This course focuses on the essential aspects of web application development, covering front-end technologies like HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS, as well as back-end technologies such as PHP and MySQL. Participants will gain hands-on experience in identifying and addressing web application vulnerabilities and potential security threats. The program emphasizes secure programming principles to mitigate risks and enhance the resilience of web applications. To date, participants have completed Lab-0, Lab-1, Lab-2, Hackathon-1, and Individual Project-1, gaining valuable practical insights into various facets of web development and security.

        <!-- Lab-0 Overview -->
        <h2>Lab-0 Overview</h2>
        <p> 
        In the initial phase of Lab 0 in the Web Application Programming and Hacking course, I successfully established the foundation for my development environment. This involved the setup of an Ubuntu 22.04 virtual machine using the UC Sandbox. To optimize the environment, I installed crucial software including apache2, git, sublime text, pandoc, and the Chrome browser. Furthermore, I created a private git repository on GitHub, sharing it with the instructor, Dr. Phu Phung. The subsequent steps included local repository cloning, editing the README.md file, and completing the Lab 0 exercises as per the instructions. The entire process was meticulously documented using Markdown, and I used the Pandoc tool to convert the document into a PDF format suitable for submission.

        <!-- Lab-1 Overview -->
        <h2>Lab-1 Overview</h2>
        <p>
         The lab was separated into two sections, with a primary focus on comprehending the workings of the Web and HTTP Protocol, followed by hands-on experience in Basic Web Application Programming. In the initial phase, I adeptly utilized the Wireshark tool to capture and analyze the communication between my machine and a web server. I diligently documented the entire process, covering aspects such as HTTP Request, Response messages, and the HTTP Stream, providing a clear understanding of the intricacies of the protocol. The latter part involved the creation of CGI web applications in C and a straightforward PHP web application, showcasing my ability to code, compile, and deploy programs on the web server. I successfully developed a Hello World CGI program, another CGI program with an HTML template, and PHP scripts. Furthermore, I examined HTTP GET and POST requests using Wireshark and curl, showcasing a comprehensive grasp of these protocols.

        <!-- Lab-2 Overview -->
        <h2>Lab-2 Overview</h2>
        <p>
        The lab is comprised of two assignments. In the initial segment, I designed a fundamental HTML page incorporating JavaScript and forms. I crafted a webpage named waph-yourusername.html with HTML elements, including an image, a form, and dynamic JavaScript features like date/time display and key press logging. The second task delved into utilizing Ajax for user input, presenting dynamic responses, implementing CSS styling, integrating jQuery for Ajax requests, and engaging in Web API interactions to retrieve programming jokes and estimate age based on user input. This laboratory experience offered practical exposure to various aspects of web development, encompassing HTML, JavaScript, Ajax, CSS, jQuery, and API integration.
        </p>
       

        <!-- Hackathon-1 Overview -->
        <h2>Hackathon-1 Overview</h2>
        <p>
        The XSS Hackathon, centered around Cross-site Scripting, serves as an educational initiative aimed at delving into and comprehending different tiers of XSS vulnerabilities within web applications. XSS, a prevalent security loophole, empowers attackers to infuse harmful scripts into web pages, visible to other users. The hackathon encompasses two primary objectives: Task 1 concentrates on recognizing and exploiting XSS vulnerabilities within a designated web application, whereas Task 2 centers on establishing protective measures against XSS attacks to diminish the likelihood of exploitation.
        </p>
       

        <!-- Individual Project-1 Overview -->
        <h2>Individual Project-1 Overview</h2>
        <p>
        The undertaking entails crafting a portfolio with the aim of showcasing my competencies and drawing the attention of prospective employers. The portfolio is now accessible in a public repository. Alongside incorporating details from my resume, I successfully fulfilled additional assignments assigned by my professor, several of which were addressed in previous laboratory exercises.
